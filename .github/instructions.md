# Copilot Instructions

1. Before implementing your own solution, examine the codebase to understand if there is some code that can be reused.
2. Ensure all changes follow clean code principles (readability, small focused functions, single responsibility, DRY, tests).
3. Follow dependency rules and SOLID principles.
4. Ensure solutions are generic enough to be reused.
5. Keep solutions as simple as possible.
6. After fixing a bug, mark it as fixed.
